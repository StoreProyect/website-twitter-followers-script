<h3>How do I remove myself as a free member?</h3>
<p>If you would like to stop our free service you can do this by simply logging into your Twitter account, clicking onto your "Application Settings" and revoking our access.</p>

<h3>Will you make any changes or updates to my account?</h3>
<p>If you are using our service as a free member the only change other than following/followers that will happen to your account is a single tweet posted on login. We will not post any further updates after signin and will never send direct messages from/to your account. If you are using the site as a premium member the only change that will happen to your account is an increase in followers.</p>

<h3>Is there any chance of my account being suspended?</h3>
<p>No, there is no chance your account will be harmed by using either our free or premium services.</p>

<h3>I signed up but have not started receiving followers yet?</h3>
<p>If you find yourself not gaining followers soon after registering for premium then there may be a problem with your details. For example, you may have entered a wrong Twitter username in which case please email us and we will modify your account and restart it.</p>
